        CHARACTER ASSIGNMENT RULES:
        1. Character IDs: char_01, char_02, char_03, etc. (consistent across all scenes)
        2. Same character = Same ID across all scenes
        3. In scenes: Only reference character_id + scene-specific info
        4. In characters section: Complete profile for each character

        OUTFIT CONSISTENCY RULES:
        1. Consider the story timeline and scene sequence
        2. Characters should wear appropriate outfits for their role and the situation
        3. Maintain outfit continuity unless there's a logical reason for change
        4. Include detailed outfit descriptions with specific clothing items
        5. Consider the character's personality, role, and the scene context
        6. Specify outfit type (casual, formal, uniform, sports, etc.)
        7. Include colors and accessories for visual consistency

        SCENE GUIDELINES:
        - Scene_ID: SC_01, SC_02, SC_03, etc.
        - Scene_Characters: Only IDs and scene-specific details (emotion, outfit, behavior)
        - Plot summary should be detailed and include character emotions
        - Environment should describe the physical setting clearly

        CHARACTER PROFILES (at the end):
        - Include complete information: name, age, role, gender, voice_information
        - overall_description: Personality, background, general traits
        - first_appearance_scene: Which scene they debut in

        LOCATION EXTRACTION RULES:
        1. Extract ALL unique locations from the script scenes
        2. Location IDs: LOC_01, LOC_02, LOC_03, etc.
        3. Include complete location information: name, type, environment, lighting, etc.
        4. Map each scene to its corresponding location
        5. Include atmospheric details and background SFX for each location
